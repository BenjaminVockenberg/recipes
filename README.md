Working like a machine? You need the right food to stay as vital as possible! Here are some personal favorite recipes!

Most of them are traditional family recipes created by my grandmother and mother. A few of them were created by myself as I was a student in Fulda, Germany.

Feel free to cook, share and modify the recipes. Let me know what you think if you want to!
