Protip:
If there is Sauerkraut Gnochhi Casserole left, its not a problem cause you can put it into the
fridge without any problems. Maybe the taste of the SGC (Sauerkraut Gnochhi Casserole) will improve over
night. This is because all the good flavors will unfold their full potential after a short idle time!
	
If you like to drink some wine to the SGC, you may choose a dry red wine.
	
If you want to have the SGC as a non veggi version you only need replace the feta with some mincemeat :)
	
If you want to have the SGC as a rich non veggi version put some additional mincemeat to all the original 
ingredients ;)
